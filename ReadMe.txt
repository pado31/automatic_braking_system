Since all my images are very heavy, in order to upload the entire folder of the project, I had to delete 3 test images and all the output images. If you want, they can be found at the following link.

In order to execute also the three missing images, they have to copied to the "images" folder and you need to modify the variable "n_images" in the main.cpp file from 12 to 15.
Anyway, I will take care to bring every missing image at the oral exam. 
Thank you.


In order to compile and execute the program, you need to open the prompt on the folder and execute the following steps:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./main
